📂 README - HTML5 Exercises

Welcome to the repository of HTML5! 🎉

This repository contains a collection of exercises designed to help you master HTML5 and become familiar with a wide variety of HTML tags. These exercises have been created using HTML5 boilerplate templates, allowing you to quickly get started and focus on the HTML content itself. 💪

🔎 What will you find in this repository? 📚

Inside this repository, you will find a carefully crafted assortment of exercises to aid you in learning and practicing different aspects of HTML5. Each exercise has its own directory and is accompanied by a corresponding HTML file that contains the base code to complete the exercise.

Headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.) 📝
Paragraphs (<p>) 📄
Ordered lists (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>) 📋
Images (<img>) 🖼️
Links (<a>) 🔗
Tables (<table>) 🗂️
Forms (<form>) and form elements (<input>, <select>, etc.) 📝📋
Structural elements (<div>, <span>, <header>, <footer>, etc.) 🏗️
Multimedia elements (<audio>, <video>) 🎵🎥
Semantic elements (<article>, <section>, <nav>, <aside>, etc.) 📖
Each exercise is designed to help you practice using and combining these tags to create content-rich web pages that are properly structured. 💡
